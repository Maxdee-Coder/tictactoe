# Tic Tac Toe
Simple Terminal game written in C. Still needs a lot of features to be added. Feel free to inform about bugs and improvements.

## Usage
Compile the source code manually with your favourite compiler and run the executable. String parameters passed to system() functions may need to be modified according to your system. Works perfectly on termux.
